		<h3><u>Defining your perfect home</u></h3>
		<p>Although our company is here to assist you in getting your dream house, finding the right
		home for you will require you to consider what you are looking for. Consider these elements
		of a home to make the process faster and easier with Real Living Real Estate:</p>
		
		<ul type="disc" style="line-height: 120%">
			<li><i><b>Location:</b></i> be sure to pay special consideration to the area in which you
			buy your house. You will want to be sure that your property has easy access to your work.
			You may also want to consider the house’s location within its neighborhood.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Size and shape:</b></i> the size of the lot your house is on will impact various
			aspects of your home’s uses and potential. The shape of the lot will affect your privacy,
			and if you have a preference in the shape of your lawn or the length of your driveway, you
			may want to consider the lot shape.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Bedrooms:</b></i> if you plan to expand your family in the future, you should
			consider a home with more bedrooms than you currently need. Extra bedrooms are ideal for
			families who intend to host guests, or they can also function as office spaces. Be sure
			to consider how you intend to use bedroom space to make the right purchase in the short and long term.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Bathrooms:</b></i> consider how many people will utilize each bathroom
			– including guests. In addition, consider if you prefer to have bathtubs or showers in each bathroom.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Kitchen layout:</b></i> if you spend significant time gathering in the kitchen,
			you may want to consider a more open kitchen layout. If you do not cook often, a smaller
			or enclosed kitchen might be sufficient for you. You should also consider if other
			household members will help you in the kitchen.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Appliances:</b></i> home appliances can be expensive to replace. Consider your
			preference for home appliances as well as the age of the current appliances in the home.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Other house features:</b></i> there may be some house features you want your
			house to have such as a library, a music room, garage, etc.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>House type:</b></i> houses have different types based on how the building houses
			people, like if there are multiple families and residents in the building or just one family.
			In addition, there are different architectural styles like how the floor plan is laid out,
			the shape of the roof, the color of the door, what type of material is used, the chimneys,
			the porch, and everything else.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Age of the house:</b></i> if you are not looking to renovate, some houses that
			meet all your requirements may have been built several decades ago. An older home may have
			its certain charm and appeal, but in turn, may need more upgrades, repairs, and improvements.
			Otherwise, you can opt to a newer built houses.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Maintenance:</b></i> include the cost of the home’s maintenance in your budget.
			Some projects may be cosmetic and easy to complete. Other projects may require more time
			and money. The age and condition of the home at the time of purchase will impact the cost
			of repairs and maintenance.</li>
			
			<li><i><b>Purchase price:</b></i> come up with a budget that is right for you. Consider
			all costs and make a decision that will accommodate your finances and goals.</li>
